Nice work!

- Six models is a bit on the bigger side. To make the app the as simple as possible, I would see if there are any
models/associations you can do without.

- Unless a column is going to potentially have a lot of characters (e.g., a user's personal bio), you
should use the `string` column, instead of `text`. I believe all of your `text` columns should be `string` instead.

- Also, make sure to use upper case for your model names. e.g., `Openhour` should be `OpenHour`.
Everywhere else, use underscores: `open_hours`

Good job.

- Some of your code (e.g., `restaurants/new.html.erb`) is still referencing a `Flight` model

- Make sure to take note of my comment about using the appropriate case from model names.

- Please remove commented out code you're no longer using.
